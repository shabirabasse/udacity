In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with 'Implementation' in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!

In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a 'Question X' header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with 'Answer:'. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.

Note: Code and Markdown cells can be executed using the Shift + Enter keyboard shortcut. In addition, Markdown cells can be edited by typically double-clicking the cell to enter edit mode.

Getting Started
In this project, you will analyze a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for internal structure. One goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. Doing so would equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.

The dataset for this project can be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. For the purposes of this project, the features 'Channel' and 'Region' will be excluded in the analysis — with focus instead on the six product categories recorded for customers.

Run the code block below to load the wholesale customers dataset, along with a few of the necessary Python libraries required for this project. You will know the dataset loaded successfully if the size of the dataset is reported.

    print("Dataset could not be loaded. Is the dataset missing?")
Wholesale customers dataset has 440 samples with 6 features each.
Data Exploration
In this section, you will begin exploring the data through visualizations and code to understand how each feature is related to the others. You will observe a statistical description of the dataset, consider the relevance of each feature, and select a few sample data points from the dataset which you will track through the course of this project.

Run the code block below to observe a statistical description of the dataset. Note that the dataset is composed of six important product categories: 'Fresh', 'Milk', 'Grocery', 'Frozen', 'Detergents_Paper', and 'Delicatessen'. Consider what each category represents in terms of products you could purchase.

Implementation: Selecting Samples
To get a better understanding of the customers and how their data will transform through the analysis, it would be best to select a few sample data points and explore them in more detail. In the code block below, add three indices of your choice to the indices list which will represent the customers to track. It is suggested to try different sets of samples until you obtain customers that vary significantly from one another.

In [3]:
# TODO: Select three indices of your choice you wish to sample from the dataset
indices = [3, 10, 111]

# Create a DataFrame of the chosen samples
samples = pd.DataFrame(data.loc[indices], columns = data.keys()).reset_index(drop = True)
print("Chosen samples of wholesale customers dataset:")
display(samples)
Chosen samples of wholesale customers dataset:
Fresh	Milk	Grocery	Frozen	Detergents_Paper	Delicatessen

2	12579	11114	17569	805	6457	1519
Question 1
Consider the total purchase cost of each product category and the statistical description of the dataset above for your sample customers.

What kind of establishment (customer) could each of the three samples you've chosen represent?
Hint: Examples of establishments include places like markets, cafes, delis, wholesale retailers, among many others. Avoid using names for establishments, such as saying "McDonalds" when describing a sample customer as a restaurant. You can use the mean values for reference to compare your samples with. The mean values are as follows:

Fresh: 12000.2977
Milk: 5796.2
Grocery: 7951.3
Detergents_paper: 2881.4
Delicatessen: 1524.8
Knowing this, how do your samples compare? Does that help in driving your insight into what kind of establishments they might be?

Answer:

Sample 1 - Fresh, Frozen and Delicatessen are well above the mean and median of the dataset for these features. This establishment looks like a small restaurant/cafe which serves dishes/snacks, hence needs more of fresh and frozen ingredients.
Sample 2 - Grocery, Frozen and Detergents_Paper are the features well above the mean and median of the dataset. This establishment looks like a grocery shop near societies where daily use products like milk, grocery etc are sold.
Sample 3 - Milk, Grocery and Detergents_Paper are the features well above the mean and median of the dataset. The spendings on these features is more than twice the mean of the dataset. This establishment looks like a wholesale retailer which buys stuff in bulk.
Implementation: Feature Relevance
One interesting thought to consider is if one (or more) of the six product categories is actually relevant for understanding customer purchasing. That is to say, is it possible to determine whether customers purchasing some amount of one category of products will necessarily purchase some proportional amount of another category of products? We can make this determination quite easily by training a supervised regression learner on a subset of the data with one feature removed, and then score how well that model can predict the removed feature.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:

Assign new_data a copy of the data by removing a feature of your choice using the DataFrame.drop function.
Use sklearn.cross_validation.train_test_split to split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Use the removed feature as your target label. Set a test_size of 0.25 and set a random_state.
Import a decision tree regressor, set a random_state, and fit the learner to the training data.
Report the prediction score of the testing set using the regressor's score function.
In [6]:
from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
# TODO: Make a copy of the DataFrame, using the 'drop' function to drop the given feature

for col in data.columns:
    
    new_data = data.drop(col, axis=1, inplace = False)

    # Set a random state.
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test =  train_test_split(new_data, data[col], test_size=0.25, random_state=42)

# TODO: Create a decision tree regressor and fit it to the training set
    regressor = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=42)
    regressor.fit(X_train,y_train)

    score = regressor.score(X_test,y_test)
    print col, score

print score

Question 2
Which feature did you attempt to predict?
What was the reported prediction score?
Is this feature necessary for identifying customers' spending habits?
Hint: The coefficient of determination, R^2, is scored between 0 and 1, with 1 being a perfect fit. A negative R^2 implies the model fails to fit the data. If you get a low score for a particular feature, that lends us to beleive that that feature point is hard to predict using the other features, thereby making it an important feature to consider when considering relevance.

Answer:

I tried to predict all features and decided upon Delicatessen.
The score is -2.25.
As the score is the most negative among all features it shows that the feature Delicatessen is most important and it has a very low correlation to other features. Leaving this feature will incorrectly identify customer's spending habits.
Visualize Feature Distributions
To get a better understanding of the dataset, we can construct a scatter matrix of each of the six product features present in the data. If you found that the feature you attempted to predict above is relevant for identifying a specific customer, then the scatter matrix below may not show any correlation between that feature and the others. Conversely, if you believe that feature is not relevant for identifying a specific customer, the scatter matrix might show a correlation between that feature and another feature in the data. Run the code block below to produce a scatter matrix.

In [8]:
# Produce a scatter matrix for each pair of features in the data
pd.scatter_matrix(data, alpha = 0.3, figsize = (14,8), diagonal = 'kde');
C:\Users\swapk\AppData\Local\conda\conda\envs\py27\lib\site-packages\ipykernel_launcher.py:2: FutureWarning: pandas.scatter_matrix is deprecated. Use pandas.plotting.scatter_matrix instead
  

Question 3
Using the scatter matrix as a reference, discuss the distribution of the dataset, specifically talk about the normality, outliers, large number of data points near 0 among others. If you need to sepearate out some of the plots individually to further accentuate your point, you may do so as well.
Are there any pairs of features which exhibit some degree of correlation?
Does this confirm or deny your suspicions about the relevance of the feature you attempted to predict?
How is the data for those features distributed?
Hint: Is the data normally distributed? Where do most of the data points lie? You can use corr() to get the feature correlations and then visualize them using a heatmap(the data that would be fed into the heatmap would be the correlation values, for eg: data.corr()) to gain further insight.

Answer:

The data is not normally distributed. This is seen in the scatter plot that most of the points are located near the origin and change in 1 feature doesn't have much change in another feature. This suggests that most of the customers are of the low consumption type like individuals or small businesses. Each plot has some outliers which suggest that it is a big business type like a supermarket or cafe.
Grocery - Detergents_Paper show the maximum correlation of 0.92, followed by Grocery - Milk of 0.73.
As suspected, Fresh does not correlate much to any of the other features, making it an important feature.
The data for these features is highly skewed and not normaly distributed.
Data Preprocessing
In this section, you will preprocess the data to create a better representation of customers by performing a scaling on the data and detecting (and optionally removing) outliers. Preprocessing data is often times a critical step in assuring that results you obtain from your analysis are significant and meaningful.

Implementation: Feature Scaling
If data is not normally distributed, especially if the mean and median vary significantly (indicating a large skew), it is most often appropriate to apply a non-linear scaling — particularly for financial data. One way to achieve this scaling is by using a Box-Cox test, which calculates the best power transformation of the data that reduces skewness. A simpler approach which can work in most cases would be applying the natural logarithm.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:

Assign a copy of the data to log_data after applying logarithmic scaling. Use the np.log function for this.
Assign a copy of the sample data to log_samples after applying logarithmic scaling. Again, use np.log.
In [11]:
# TODO: Scale the data using the natural logarithm
log_data = np.log(data)

# TODO: Scale the sample data using the natural logarithm
log_samples = np.log(samples)

# Produce a scatter matrix for each pair of newly-transformed features
pd.scatter_matrix(log_data, alpha = 0.3, figsize = (14,8), diagonal = 'kde');
C:\Users\swapk\AppData\Local\conda\conda\envs\py27\lib\site-packages\ipykernel_launcher.py:8: FutureWarning: pandas.scatter_matrix is deprecated. Use pandas.plotting.scatter_matrix instead
  

Observation
After applying a natural logarithm scaling to the data, the distribution of each feature should appear much more normal. For any pairs of features you may have identified earlier as being correlated, observe here whether that correlation is still present (and whether it is now stronger or weaker than before).

Run the code below to see how the sample data has changed after having the natural logarithm applied to it.

In [12]:

Implementation: Outlier Detection
Detecting outliers in the data is extremely important in the data preprocessing step of any analysis. The presence of outliers can often skew results which take into consideration these data points. There are many "rules of thumb" for what constitutes an outlier in a dataset. Here, we will use Tukey's Method for identfying outliers: An outlier step is calculated as 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR). A data point with a feature that is beyond an outlier step outside of the IQR for that feature is considered abnormal.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:

Assign the value of the 25th percentile for the given feature to Q1. Use np.percentile for this.
Assign the value of the 75th percentile for the given feature to Q3. Again, use np.percentile.
Assign the calculation of an outlier step for the given feature to step.
Optionally remove data points from the dataset by adding indices to the outliers list.
NOTE: If you choose to remove any outliers, ensure that the sample data does not contain any of these points!
Once you have performed this implementation, the dataset will be stored in the variable good_data.

In [13]:
# For each feature find the data points with extreme high or low values
for feature in log_data.keys():
    
    # TODO: Calculate Q1 (25th percentile of the data) for the given feature
    Q1 = np.percentile(log_data[feature],25)
    
    # TODO: Calculate Q3 (75th percentile of the data) for the given feature
    Q3 = np.percentile(log_data[feature],75)

    step = (Q3-Q1)*1.5
    
    # Display the outliers
    print("Data points considered outliers for the feature '{}':".format(feature))
    display(log_data[~((log_data[feature] >= Q1 - step) & (log_data[feature] <= Q3 + step))])
    
# OPTIONAL: Select the indices for data points you wish to remove
outliers  = [65,66,75,128,154]

# Remove the outliers, if any were specified
good_data = log_data.drop(log_data.index[outliers]).reset_index(drop = True)

Question 4
Are there any data points considered outliers for more than one feature based on the definition above?
Should these data points be removed from the dataset?
If any data points were added to the outliers list to be removed, explain why.
Hint: If you have datapoints that are outliers in multiple categories think about why that may be and if they warrant removal. Also note how k-means is affected by outliers and whether or not this plays a factor in your analysis of whether or not to remove them.

Answer:

Data points as outliers for more than 1 feature:
154: Delicatessen, Milk and Grocery.
128: Delicatessen and Fresh.
75: Detergents_Paper and Grocery.
66: Delicatessen and Fresh
65: Frozen and Fresh
Removing just 5 of the ouliers can be done for this data as these are the ones present in multiple features. Other than these 5, we should keep the others as they might contain useful information of a specific type of customer that is different from the others.
I've added the above 5 points to the outliers list.
Feature Transformation
In this section you will use principal component analysis (PCA) to draw conclusions about the underlying structure of the wholesale customer data. Since using PCA on a dataset calculates the dimensions which best maximize variance, we will find which compound combinations of features best describe customers.

Implementation: PCA
Now that the data has been scaled to a more normal distribution and has had any necessary outliers removed, we can now apply PCA to the good_data to discover which dimensions about the data best maximize the variance of features involved. In addition to finding these dimensions, PCA will also report the explained variance ratio of each dimension — how much variance within the data is explained by that dimension alone. Note that a component (dimension) from PCA can be considered a new "feature" of the space, however it is a composition of the original features present in the data.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:

Import sklearn.decomposition.PCA and assign the results of fitting PCA in six dimensions with good_data to pca.
Apply a PCA transformation of log_samples using pca.transform, and assign the results to pca_samples.
In [15]:
# TODO: Apply PCA by fitting the good data with the same number of dimensions as features
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=len(good_data.columns)).fit(good_data)

# TODO: Transform log_samples using the PCA fit above
pca_samples = pca.transform(log_samples)

# Generate PCA results plot
pca_results = vs.pca_results(good_data, pca)

Question 5
How much variance in the data is explained in total by the first and second principal component?
How much variance in the data is explained by the first four principal components?
Using the visualization provided above, talk about each dimension and the cumulative variance explained by each, stressing upon which features are well represented by each dimension(both in terms of positive and negative variance explained). Discuss what the first four dimensions best represent in terms of customer spending.
Hint: A positive increase in a specific dimension corresponds with an increase of the positive-weighted features and a decrease of the negative-weighted features. The rate of increase or decrease is based on the individual feature weights.

Observations, according to flipped signs:
1st PC: This PC relies mostly on Detergents_paper, Milk and Grocery. Like we identified earlier, these are the 3 most correlated features with large negative correlation to PC1. A customer in this category should be a convenience store or supermarket.
2nd PC - This PC relies mostly on Fresh, Frozen and Delicatessen. Here the other 3 features are recovered with large negative correlation to PC2. A customer in this category should be a restaurant.
3rd PC - This PC relies mostly on Fresh, Frozen and Delicatessen. Fresh has large negative correlation while Delicatessen has large positive correlation. A customer in this category should be a small grocery shop near societies for basic daily products.
4th PC - This PC relies mostly on Frozen and Delicatessen with large positive correlation for Frozen and large negative correlation for Delicatessen. A customer in this category should be a retailer of imported goods or meat shop.
Observation
Run the code below to see how the log-transformed sample data has changed after having a PCA transformation applied to it in six dimensions. Observe the numerical value for the first four dimensions of the sample points. Consider if this is consistent with your initial interpretation of the sample points.

In [17]:
# Display sample log-data after having a PCA transformation applied
display(pd.DataFrame(np.round(pca_samples, 4), columns = pca_results.index.values))
Dimension 1	Dimension 2	Dimension 3	Dimension 4	Dimension 5	Dimension 6

2	-2.6304	-0.8318	-0.6545	-0.4757	0.1064	0.0954
Implementation: Dimensionality Reduction
When using principal component analysis, one of the main goals is to reduce the dimensionality of the data — in effect, reducing the complexity of the problem. Dimensionality reduction comes at a cost: Fewer dimensions used implies less of the total variance in the data is being explained. Because of this, the cumulative explained variance ratio is extremely important for knowing how many dimensions are necessary for the problem. Additionally, if a signifiant amount of variance is explained by only two or three dimensions, the reduced data can be visualized afterwards.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:

Assign the results of fitting PCA in two dimensions with good_data to pca.
Apply a PCA transformation of good_data using pca.transform, and assign the results to reduced_data.
Apply a PCA transformation of log_samples using pca.transform, and assign the results to pca_samples.
In [18]:
# TODO: Apply PCA by fitting the good data with only two dimensions
pca = PCA(n_components=2).fit(good_data)

# TODO: Transform the good data using the PCA fit above
reduced_data = pca.transform(good_data)

# TODO: Transform log_samples using the PCA fit above
pca_samples = pca.transform(log_samples)

# Create a DataFrame for the reduced data
reduced_data = pd.DataFrame(reduced_data, columns = ['Dimension 1', 'Dimension 2'])
Observation
Run the code below to see how the log-transformed sample data has changed after having a PCA transformation applied to it using only two dimensions. Observe how the values for the first two dimensions remains unchanged when compared to a PCA transformation in six dimensions.

In [19]:
# Display sample log-data after applying PCA transformation in two dimensions
display(pd.DataFrame(np.round(pca_samples, 4), columns = ['Dimension 1', 'Dimension 2']))
Dimension 1	Dimension 2
0	1.1553	-1.4052
1	-2.0887	-0.7006
2	-2.6304	-0.8318
Visualizing a Biplot
A biplot is a scatterplot where each data point is represented by its scores along the principal components. The axes are the principal components (in this case Dimension 1 and Dimension 2). In addition, the biplot shows the projection of the original features along the components. A biplot can help us interpret the reduced dimensions of the data, and discover relationships between the principal components and original features.

Run the code cell below to produce a biplot of the reduced-dimension data.

In [20]:
# Create a biplot
vs.biplot(good_data, reduced_data, pca)
Out[20]:
<matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0xe0600b8>

Observation
Once we have the original feature projections (in red), it is easier to interpret the relative position of each data point in the scatterplot. For instance, a point the lower right corner of the figure will likely correspond to a customer that spends a lot on 'Milk', 'Grocery' and 'Detergents_Paper', but not so much on the other product categories.

From the biplot, which of the original features are most strongly correlated with the first component? What about those that are associated with the second component? Do these observations agree with the pca_results plot you obtained earlier?

Clustering
In this section, you will choose to use either a K-Means clustering algorithm or a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm to identify the various customer segments hidden in the data. You will then recover specific data points from the clusters to understand their significance by transforming them back into their original dimension and scale.

Question 6
What are the advantages to using a K-Means clustering algorithm?
What are the advantages to using a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm?
Given your observations about the wholesale customer data so far, which of the two algorithms will you use and why?
Hint: Think about the differences between hard clustering and soft clustering and which would be appropriate for our dataset.

Answer:

The advantage of K-means is that it is robust, reliable and fast. This allows the model to outperform other algorithms on large datasets. In addition, this algorithm performs best on data that is clearly defined and well sperated.
The advantage of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is its capability of incorporating the covariance between the points into the model to identify more complex clusters. Unlike K-means which assumes during each iteration, that any given point can only belong to a specific cluster.
Given the above scatter plot, the data appears to be quite uniform. A lot of data points don't clearly belong to one particular cluster. We can also observe that certain dimensions in the data (i.e. Milk-Grocery-Detergents and Fresh-Frozen) have a strong degree of correlation between each other. It seems more logical to adopt a Gaussian Mixture Model in this case.
Implementation: Creating Clusters
Depending on the problem, the number of clusters that you expect to be in the data may already be known. When the number of clusters is not known a priori, there is no guarantee that a given number of clusters best segments the data, since it is unclear what structure exists in the data — if any. However, we can quantify the "goodness" of a clustering by calculating each data point's silhouette coefficient. The silhouette coefficient for a data point measures how similar it is to its assigned cluster from -1 (dissimilar) to 1 (similar). Calculating the mean silhouette coefficient provides for a simple scoring method of a given clustering.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:

Fit a clustering algorithm to the reduced_data and assign it to clusterer.
Predict the cluster for each data point in reduced_data using clusterer.predict and assign them to preds.
Find the cluster centers using the algorithm's respective attribute and assign them to centers.
Predict the cluster for each sample data point in pca_samples and assign them sample_preds.
Import sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score and calculate the silhouette score of reduced_data against preds.
Assign the silhouette score to score and print the result.
In [21]:
# TODO: Apply your clustering algorithm of choice to the reduced data 
from sklearn.mixture import GMM
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score

def getScores(num_clusters):
    clusterer = GMM(n_components=num_clusters, random_state=42).fit(reduced_data)

    # TODO: Predict the cluster for each data point
    preds = clusterer.predict(reduced_data)

    # TODO: Find the cluster centers
    centers = clusterer.means_

    # TODO: Predict the cluster for each transformed sample data point
    sample_preds = clusterer.predict(pca_samples)

    # TODO: Calculate the mean silhouette coefficient for the number of clusters chosen
    score = silhouette_score(reduced_data,preds)
    return score

scores = pd.DataFrame(columns=['Silhouette Score'])
scores.columns.name = 'Number of Clusters'    
for i in range(2,10):
    score = getScores(i) 
    scores = scores.append(pd.DataFrame([score],columns=['Silhouette Score'],index=[i]))

display(scores)

Number of Clusters	Silhouette Score
2	0.411819
3	0.373561
4	0.331389
5	0.280983
6	0.277982
7	0.322543
8	0.309424
9	0.314964
Question 7
Report the silhouette score for several cluster numbers you tried.
Of these, which number of clusters has the best silhouette score?
Answer:

The scores are displayed above for clusters in range 2-9.
Best silhouette score is achieved when number of clusters is 2.
Cluster Visualization
Once you've chosen the optimal number of clusters for your clustering algorithm using the scoring metric above, you can now visualize the results by executing the code block below. Note that, for experimentation purposes, you are welcome to adjust the number of clusters for your clustering algorithm to see various visualizations. The final visualization provided should, however, correspond with the optimal number of clusters.

In [22]:
# TODO: Apply your clustering algorithm of choice to the reduced data 
clusterer = GMM(n_components=2).fit(reduced_data)

# TODO: Predict the cluster for each data point
preds = clusterer.predict(reduced_data)

# TODO: Find the cluster centers
centers = clusterer.means_

# TODO: Predict the cluster for each transformed sample data point
sample_preds = clusterer.predict(pca_samples)

# TODO: Calculate the mean silhouette coefficient for the number of clusters chosen
score = silhouette_score(reduced_data,preds)

print score
0.411818864386

In [23]:
# Display the results of the clustering from implementation
vs.cluster_results(reduced_data, preds, centers, pca_samples)

Implementation: Data Recovery
Each cluster present in the visualization above has a central point. These centers (or means) are not specifically data points from the data, but rather the averages of all the data points predicted in the respective clusters. For the problem of creating customer segments, a cluster's center point corresponds to the average customer of that segment. Since the data is currently reduced in dimension and scaled by a logarithm, we can recover the representative customer spending from these data points by applying the inverse transformations.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:

Apply the inverse transform to centers using pca.inverse_transform and assign the new centers to log_centers.
Apply the inverse function of np.log to log_centers using np.exp and assign the true centers to true_centers.
In [24]:
# TODO: Inverse transform the centers
log_centers = pca.inverse_transform(centers)

# TODO: Exponentiate the centers
true_centers = np.exp(log_centers)

# Display the true centers
segments = ['Segment {}'.format(i) for i in range(0,len(centers))]
true_centers = pd.DataFrame(np.round(true_centers), columns = data.keys())
true_centers.index = segments
display(true_centers)
Fresh	Milk	Grocery	Frozen	Detergents_Paper	Delicatessen
Segment 0	4316.0	6347.0	9555.0	1036.0	3046.0	945.0
Segment 1	8812.0	2052.0	2689.0	2058.0	337.0	712.0
Question 8
Consider the total purchase cost of each product category for the representative data points above, and reference the statistical description of the dataset at the beginning of this project(specifically looking at the mean values for the various feature points). What set of establishments could each of the customer segments represent?
Hint: A customer who is assigned to 'Cluster X' should best identify with the establishments represented by the feature set of 'Segment X'. Think about what each segment represents in terms their values for the feature points chosen. Reference these values with the mean values to get some perspective into what kind of establishment they represent.

Answer:

Segment 0: spends on Milk, Grocery and Detergents_Paper are above mean values and Frozen almost close. According to me this segment contains individuals, grocery shops, supermarkets etc.
Segment 1: main spending on Fresh and Frozen. According to me this segment contains restaurants, cafes etc.
Question 9
For each sample point, which customer segment from Question 8 best represents it?
Are the predictions for each sample point consistent with this?*
Run the code block below to find which cluster each sample point is predicted to be.

In [25]:
# Display the predictions
for i, pred in enumerate(sample_preds):
    print("Sample point", i, "predicted to be in Cluster", pred)
('Sample point', 0, 'predicted to be in Cluster', 1)
('Sample point', 1, 'predicted to be in Cluster', 0)
('Sample point', 2, 'predicted to be in Cluster', 0)
Answer:

This model acuurately predicts the segments which I thought for these points.
Sample 0: intuition - restaurant, predicted - Segment 1(restaurants)
Sample 1: intuition - grocery store, predicted - Segment 0(stores/individuals)
Sample 2: intuition - wholesale retailer, predicted - Segment 0(stores/individuals)
Conclusion
In this final section, you will investigate ways that you can make use of the clustered data. First, you will consider how the different groups of customers, the customer segments, may be affected differently by a specific delivery scheme. Next, you will consider how giving a label to each customer (which segment that customer belongs to) can provide for additional features about the customer data. Finally, you will compare the customer segments to a hidden variable present in the data, to see whether the clustering identified certain relationships.

Question 10
Companies will often run A/B tests when making small changes to their products or services to determine whether making that change will affect its customers positively or negatively. The wholesale distributor is considering changing its delivery service from currently 5 days a week to 3 days a week. However, the distributor will only make this change in delivery service for customers that react positively.

How can the wholesale distributor use the customer segments to determine which customers, if any, would react positively to the change in delivery service?*
Hint: Can we assume the change affects all customers equally? How can we determine which group of customers it affects the most?

Answer:

Looking at the 2 segments, Segment 1 users rely mainly on Fresh items. Changing delivery service from 5 days a week to 3 days a week will affect these users in a negative way.

On the other hand, Segment 0 users spend less on Fresh and more on items that can be stored for some time. So, changing delivery service might affect these users positively.

The wholesale distributor should pick samples from both the segments and try the new service on both to get feedbacks. The hypothesis that Segment 0 should respond positively can be tested correctly.

Question 11
Additional structure is derived from originally unlabeled data when using clustering techniques. Since each customer has a customer segment it best identifies with (depending on the clustering algorithm applied), we can consider 'customer segment' as an engineered feature for the data. Assume the wholesale distributor recently acquired ten new customers and each provided estimates for anticipated annual spending of each product category. Knowing these estimates, the wholesale distributor wants to classify each new customer to a customer segment to determine the most appropriate delivery service.

How can the wholesale distributor label the new customers using only their estimated product spending and the customer segment data?
Hint: A supervised learner could be used to train on the original customers. What would be the target variable?

Answer:

The wholesale distributor can train a supervised learning classification algorithm like SVM or decision tree classifier with the initial dataset's customer spending as inputs and customer segments as the target variable.

Visualizing Underlying Distributions
At the beginning of this project, it was discussed that the 'Channel' and 'Region' features would be excluded from the dataset so that the customer product categories were emphasized in the analysis. By reintroducing the 'Channel' feature to the dataset, an interesting structure emerges when considering the same PCA dimensionality reduction applied earlier to the original dataset.

Run the code block below to see how each data point is labeled either 'HoReCa' (Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe) or 'Retail' the reduced space. In addition, you will find the sample points are circled in the plot, which will identify their labeling.

In [26]:
# Display the clustering results based on 'Channel' data
vs.channel_results(reduced_data, outliers, pca_samples)

Question 12
How well does the clustering algorithm and number of clusters you've chosen compare to this underlying distribution of Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe customers to Retailer customers?
Are there customer segments that would be classified as purely 'Retailers' or 'Hotels/Restaurants/Cafes' by this distribution?
Would you consider these classifications as consistent with your previous definition of the customer segments?
Answer:

The algorithm GMM clustering was able to establish the key relationships very well. These even match the intuitions I had at the starting. The numbers of clusters decided through GMM also matches the number of channels.

There are customer segments that would be purely classified as "Retailers" or "Hotels/"Restaurants/Cafes" on the extreme left and right respectively.
